# Madpy Lightning Talk: Binder

From the [Binder documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html):

> Binder allows you to create custom computing environments that can be shared and used by many remote users. It is powered by BinderHub, which is an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service in the cloud. One-such deployment lives here, at mybinder.org, and is free to use.
